accessibilityProblems:
  - Users can be timed out after a period of inactivity without prior warning. This can be difficult for users that need more time to read content or perform functions.
  - The page title is the same on every file upload page. This can be disorientating for users of screen readers as it is harder to identify their location and the purpose of the page.
  - The ‘choose file’ option has not been marked up using a label. This can make it more difficult for screen reader users to understand their purpose and how to action the input.
  - After you have uploaded a file and selected ‘check for errors’, a loading symbol appears on screen. This loading symbol is not announced to users with screen readers. This can make it difficult for users with screen readers to understand what is going on in the page. There is some alt text which describes the loading symbol but this is only provided if you navigate through the page again.
  - On the file upload page, there is a label above the ‘Choose file’ button that could be confusing. The label is supposed to read ‘Upload a file’.
  - The heading on the first page of the service contains the abbreviation ‘ERS’. This can make it difficult to understand what the page means. ‘ERS’ should be written out in full as Employment Related Securities.
  - On every page, the colour of the focus indicator does not have a strong enough colour contrast. This might make it difficult for some users to see.
